These are some of the must-have VS Code extensions for your development environment:

### 1. Git Copilot / Git Copilot Chat

**GitHub Copilot** offers autocomplete suggestions, either when you start writing code or by adding a comment describing what you want to do. **Git Copilot Chat** is a complement to GitHub Copilot that provides a conversational way to develop software. Either option you choose will help you write or explain code, correct errors, and even do documentation. If you are a student, teacher, or maintain a popular open-source project, you can get these extensions for free; otherwise, you will have a 30-day free trial before needing to pay.

### 2. Git graph

It facilitates the graphical visualization of a repository's Git history and allows the execution of actions directly from this visual environment.

### 3. GitLens

Developed by **GitKraken**, this extension allows you to know all the details (who, when, modified lines, code evolution, added and deleted files, etc.) of the changes made in the project, in short, enhancing your Git experience.

Although it's not necessary to pay to use it in VS Code, there is a paid version with additional features. You can check the prices and more services from GitKraken on their  {{<externalLink href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" title="official website">}}.

### 4. Live server

With this extension, you can launch a local development server that displays your page in real-time, automatically reflecting any changes you make. It's compatible with any browser and is especially useful for those who are starting out in web development.

### 5. Error lens 

**Error Lens** allows you to manage errors that arise in your code. Among the functionalities it offers are: displaying additional information about errors, configuring the display of certain errors differently from others, and providing possible solutions for the errors found.

### 6. Prettier

Unlike the extensions mentioned earlier, **Prettier** focuses on the code's aesthetics by providing a different style than the default one. This tool ensures that all code written in the project always maintains the same format. It is compatible with multiple programming languages, so now your only concern will be whether your code works and not if it's properly indented or if functions have different styles.
