# An Idea
The idea of creating 'Code with B' is to share my knowledge, experiences, and more with people who are starting in the world of technology. I hope this page is of great help to those who are beginning their journey into the world of coding.

# And a Laptop
I don't remember who said it, but all you need is an idea, a dream, and a laptop.
